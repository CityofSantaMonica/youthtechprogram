                <h1>Data Exploration and Storytelling</h1>
                <blockquote>“In God we trust, all others bring data.” – William Edward Deming, father of Total Quality Management. </blockquote>
                <p>There is no denying that our world is becoming increasingly interconnected with data. Every product we purchase, every prescription we fill, every course we register for are captured in databases to be analyzed by someone, somewhere (hopefully for good.)</p>
                <p>Like other industries, government is rich with data, and looking to do more. Cities like Santa Monica are seeking to better understanding our residents (increasingly referred to as customers.)
                <p>The City of Santa Monica has numerous data points that we are proud to make publicly available via our highly rated open data program, available at <a target="_blank" href="https://data.smgov.net">data.smgov.net</a>. </p>
                <p><strong>This is where your assignment begins.</strong> You are being  asked to take one of the two roles described below, and use the City’s publicly available data to create value for others. As you approach your task, remember that the data alone, while raw and factual, doesn’t tell a story that the average person can understand. Try to dive deep into the data and find correlations and/or causation to help strengthen your position(s). </p>
                <h2>Available Roles</h2>
                <h3>The Master Storyteller</h3>
                <p>You believe people care more about stories than data. You think data is of some value, but only as it pertains to pushing your agenda. Look at the available datasets and tell a compelling story. Your goal is to convince people to care about and get excited about your story. The story can be positive, negative, or neutral. The tone doesn’t matter as much as how engaged and excited people are to hear your story. </p>
                <p>Beware! Some might call you a great storyteller, others may call you a manipulator. Consider ahead of time what holes your detractors and rivals might shoot in your story. Be prepared with contingency plans in the event you are challenged. </p>
                <h3>The Master Researcher</h3>
                <p>You are a cold, data processing machine. Your only mission is to find patterns and trends in data. You are purely objective and you only care about presenting the facts. You also have an interest in the causation and/or correlation for your datasets. Create hypotheses for the trends and patterns you have identified in your data. </p>
                <p>Just as the storyteller will have their detractors, you too will be scrutinized. You will be labeled uncharismatic and irrelevant because you don’t have a great story that connects with people – you must focus on the value and let the data sell itself. Make sure that your research is strong and relevant to the average person.</p>
