By the end of the program I didnâ€™t only learn about business and technology. I learned how to work and talk with new people, which is necessary for jobs, school and life in general. I learned how to manage my stress, which is useful for when I have loads of work, and by the end of the program I finally learned what I wanted to study in college.
