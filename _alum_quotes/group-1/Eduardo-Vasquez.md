Youth Tech provides an aspiring individual with the basic necessary essentials needed to prosper within a fast paced workplace. It has personally prepared me for various types of businesses whether it be technological based or just a general business/job. Utilizing the skills developed within the six-week program I was a leader at my job during the summer, where management entrusted me to independently be in charge of a challenging position that managers usually only did, but left me in charge knowing I was capable of being successful.
