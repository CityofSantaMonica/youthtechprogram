#   type:
#     primary:   # The primary chart type: Line, Bar, or Pie
#     secondary: # The secondary chart type. This is to be used if you're extending the default chart options but adding
#                # more options. For example, using a "Percent" secondary type will allow you to create a LinePercentOptions
#                # object in JavaScript that will be used. When creating this object, use jQuery's $.extend() to extend
#                # the original options.
